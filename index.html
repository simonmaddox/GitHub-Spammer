		<h1>GitHub Spammer</h1>
		<h2>By Simon Maddox</h2>
		<p>
			When looking at the GitHub API docs this evening, I noticed that they give out email addresses over unauthenticated API requests.<br /><br />

			Realising this is pretty bad, I set about creating something to exploit it. What you see here is an hour's work, but it proves the concept nicely.<br /><br />

			You'll need to enter your SMTP server settings in SMTP_OPTIONS, or configure <a href="">Pony</a> some other way.<br /><br />
